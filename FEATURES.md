## New Options in the Options Menu
Many options have been added to the game's options menu. To be clear, there are **5 pages of options** now. **Use the Next button on the options page** to cycle through the pages when in-game.

- The first page contains the original game's options. Text speed has an "Instant" option now, and the "Slow" option is now the original game's "Medium". The game defaults to "Fast" speed. Other than that, the way Battle Style and Battle Animations options work haven't changed.

- The second page contains new big features related to general gameplay.
  - The first option, `COLORS` will cycle between color palette options of the game. These only apply if you're playing on a system that supports color, like GBC, GBA, Super Gameboy, etc. Important to note: On Super Gameboy after changing this setting you will need to save and restart the game to apply the change. On GBC and GBA it's instant.
    - `OG`: Default color setting. The game will use whatever colors it originally would have had on the system you're playing on. In the case of GBC or GBA, this is a hardcoded limited dual-color palette. On SGB, this is the default SGB color palettes.
    - `SGB`: Force SGB color palettes. This is no different than the "OG" setting if playing on SGB. On GBC or GBA, this changes the game to use the same color palettes as on SGB, and enables full color mode. Attack animations will have color in this mode when on GBC or GBA, along with some other color enhancements.
    - `GBC`: Force GBC color palettes. On Super Gameboy, it'll now have Pokemon Yellow's GBC more intense color palettes. Same with GBC and GBA. On GBC and GBA, enables full color mode. Attack animations will have color in this mode when on GBC or GBA, along with some other color enhancements.
  - The second option, `ALT PKMN COLORS` will enable or disable pokemon from being able to have special color palettes (Default: OFF). When turned on, features related to alternate color pokemon are enabled. In certain regions, you will find differently colored pokemon, like blue nidorinos and purple nidorinas. Think of them as regional color variants. This is just an amusing feature to allow for additional enjoyment in finding unique pokemon by exploring different places.
  - The third option, `AUDIO PAN` will enable or disable stereo audio panning (Default: OFF). The game uses stereo audio by default, but every channel is played at equal volume throughout the right and left speaker, so it sounds like mono. With this turned on the game music sounds a bit more dynamic by panning certain channels to left or right. This was an option in Pokemon Yellow that was ported to this romhack.
  - The fourth option, `BIKE SONG` will enable or disable the music that plays while on the bicycle (Default: ON). Since the bicycle music plays 100% of the time you are using the bicycle, it gets a bit old after a while. If turned off, the only time you'll hear the music is in Cycling Road. This way you can enjoy all the music in the game, not just the bicycle song.

- The third page contains settings related to battles.
  - The first four options, `GHSTxPSY`, `ICExFIRE`, `BUGxPSN`, `PSNxBUG` all control type matchups in the game. The option on the left for these is the original game's type matchup, and the right option is what it was changed to in Gen 2. These options allow you to fine-tune how you want type matchups to behave. The only non-original one is GHSTxPSY, which is set to make Ghost super effective against Psychic by default. In the original game Psychic was immune to Ghost, which the game even tells you isn't supposed to be the case in NPC dialogue.
  - The fifth option, `EXP BAR` enables or disables an experience bar visual in battle. (Default: OFF) This feature allows easier tracking of experience while in battle.
  - The sixth option, `NPC EVs` enables or disables giving opponent trainer pokemon Stat EXP based on their pokemon's level. (Default: OFF) In the original game, they receive 0 stat EXP regardless of the level of their pokemon. This means if the player has a lot of stat EXP, they will totally outclass similar-level trainer pokemon. Turning this feature on will give trainer pokemon stat EXP scaled with their level to a reasonable degree. This makes the game a bit harder but can be fun for more experienced players.

- The fourth page contains Sprite-related options.
  - The first option, `BACK` changes the back sprites in the game. (Default: OG) There are two possible settings:
    - OG: Use the original blocky back sprites. 
    - SW97: Use the spaceworld 1997 back sprites. (some have been touched up a bit) These are higher resolution while still matching the original game's style. Very nice!
  - The second option, `ICONS` changes the menu icons and overworld sprites in the game. (Default: OG) If you change this while in the overworld, it won't come into effect visually until you load another map (like by going into or out of a building.) There are two possible settings:
    - OG: Use the original icons in the overworld and on the pokemon menu.
    - OGplus: Use the original icons with some new ones. Some are based on beta sprites, some are completely newly designed sprites with the intention of being similar to the non-specific icon design of the original game, and ONE based on Gen 2's menu sprites (jellyfish sprite). This also will give unique sprites to Brock, Misty, Sabrina, and Blaine. They are all sprites that were designed from scratch to match the game's original trainer sprites, EXCEPT blaine's sprite, which is borrowed from Gen 2.
  - The third to sixth options all control front sprites of specific pokemon that have multiple nice front sprites from the original games to choose from. You can choose which front sprites you like the most for these pokemon.

- The fifth page contains 6 additional pokemon whose front sprites can be customized.

## New Gameplay Features
- Ghost Marowak can be caught, and if you have Alt Pkmn Palettes turned on, it has a special ghostly coloration. It wants revenge on Team Rocket!

- The Safari Zone now has 3 different "Modes" of Safari Game. They are:
  - `CLASSIC`: the original game's "Safari Game".  Use bait and rocks instead of your well-trained pokemon to try to catch wild pokemon with Safari Balls. The only change to this mode is that you have 700 steps instead of 500.
  - `FREE ROAM`: Bring your pokemon into the Safari Zone and catch and battle pokemon like you would normally. Also, no limit on steps! On top of that, now there are trainers ready to battle all over the Safari Zone? This is great! The trainers will reset when you re-enter, allowing you to repeatedly battle them.
  - `RANGER HUNT`: now we're talking. Find the 5 rangers and defeat them before you run out of steps! You get a special prize if you do! Bring in your pokemon just like FREE ROAM mode, but you only have 700 steps to find and beat all 5 rangers! All the trainers from Free Roam mode are present too. This is the ultimate Safari Zone challenge! The reward is a new type of Poke Ball, the HYPER BALL, which never fails to catch pokemon if they are <1/4 health. Even legendary pokemon!

- New Items:
  - `POCKET ABRA`: It's an Abra that fits in your bag. A pocket pokemon! Isn't that redundant?...It allows you to teleport whenever you want, even in buildings or caves, back to the last pokemon center. Keep it on hand at all times for maximum convenience.
  - `BOOSTER CHIP`: Replaces `EXP.ALL` - Oak's aide on Route 15 will give you this if you catch at least 70 pokemon. When you install it to your pokeball belt, all your pokemon will gain boosted EXP as if they were traded pokemon! Great for training up pokemon when you're trying to catch them all.
  - `APEX CHIP`: The Gym Guide's creation! It maximizes DVs when installed. The Gym Guide will give you 2 of them after you beat each gym leader. Inside a pokemon's pokeball, this chip will simulate their natural habitat, helping them be happy and achieve their maximum potential! 

- The Mt Moon fossil Super Nerd will offer to take your fossil to Cinnabar Lab right away! You have to meet up with him at his house in SAFFRON CITY to get your fossil pokemon if you give it to him. Then you can give him OLD AMBER too. This allows you to receive fossil pokemon early.
- You can obtain the fossil that you didn't choose in Mt.Moon hidden inside Seafoam Islands.
- In Fuchsia City there is an NPC who will permanently remove CUT trees for a fee. Remove all the trees in Fuchsia City, the one blocking Route 9, and more!
