If you'd like to make your own romhack based on this one, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).

This is a purist's enhancement of Pokemon Red/Blue/Green. The goal is to enhance the original games for excellent replayability without bringing in mechanics, moves, sprites, visuals, type matchups, or pokemon that were introduced in later games. It makes the bulk of the 151 original pokemon all more obtainable and usable in the early game, with better movesets and more balanced stats. Many moves in the game were rebalanced or modified. There are more bug, poison, and ghost type moves available. The focus is on getting a useful set of moves available for every single pokemon in the game. Front sprites were updated to be just about the best set of sprites from Red/Green/Blue/Yellow/Spaceworld 1997 overall. All 151 pokemon are obtainable in all versions of this hack. Many small quality-of-life tweaks were made. Move bugs that can be used to your own advantage (like the leech seed/toxic bug, the hyper beam no recharge on faint bug, etc.) are unchanged, because they are quirks of the battle engine that you can use as your own tool. Many options to enhance the game were added. (You must turn them on via the options in-game!)
