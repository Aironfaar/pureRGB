# Pokémon PureRGB (PureRed, PureGreen, PureBlue)

A purist's enhancement of Pokémon Red, Green, and Blue based on the pokered disassembly, created by Vortyne. Please see the original github page for information about this hack: https://github.com/Vortyne/pureRGB

## Fork Changes

Some of the modifications are supposed to make certain mono type runs go a bit more smoothly:
- Arcanine, Parasect and Venusaur can now learn Surf. With this change,  Flash, Cut, Strength, Fly or Dig, and Surf.
- You can now find at least one pokémon of each type before reaching Pewter City. One of them requires interaction with a new NPC, the others are out there in the wild.
- Seel is now Water/Ice instead of Ice. This was the only somewhat reasonable way to provide a proper Ice type pokémon before reaching Pewter City. You can disable this change at the usual Type Changer NPC.

Others are simply modifications to my personal taste:
- Gyarados can now learn Fly.
- Splash is now a signature move for Magikarps of level 20 or higher, as well as for Gyarados. The Move Mystic will tell you more. To make sure that Gyarados can be encountered in the wild with Splash, they now know Splash at level 1.
- Cursed Gengar now has different stats. The Dark and Light Channeler that inflict and remove the curse will inform you of the exact stat changes. To emphasize the new stat spread of Cursed Gengar, Gastly, Haunter and Gengar now learn Poison Gas instead of Filthy Slam at level 41. They can still learn Filthy Slam via TM.
- Wild Missingno. are diversified. Before the change, catching one of them felt like a cheat since they were all already at level 120. Now, they appear at levels 40 to 120, and due to additions of TM moves (which it could learn already anyway) to its natural learnset, every level of wild Missingno. has a different moveset.
- Some encounter tables have been touched upon for nitpicky reasons, like wondering how a horse, flaming or not, could live in the rugged terrain of a volcanic mountain.
- All unevolved and non-evolving pokémon except Zapdos, Articuno, Moltres, Mewtwo, Mew and the fossil pokémon can now be encountered in the wild in either palette somewhere in the world. This means you can catch them all in whichever palette you like best. To facilitate this, some encounter tables have been changed, in particular the entire Safari Zone.
- Fossil pokémon are now revived with their normal or alternate palette, chosen at random.
- Team Rocket now offers fossils and ambers as Game Corner prizes. So that's what they were in Mt. Moon for! Since the fossils and amber can now be replaced, they are no longer key items. However, like the Master Ball, they are invaluable, so they sell for nothing. The TMs that would normally be offered as prizes are now sold in the Celadon Department Store.
