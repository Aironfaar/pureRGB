# Pokémon PureRGB (PureRed, PureGreen, PureBlue)

A purist's enhancement of Pokémon Red, Green, and Blue based on the pokered disassembly, created by Vortyne. Please see the original github page for information about this hack: https://github.com/Vortyne/pureRGB

## Fork Changes

- Modifications to make mono type runs smoother:
  - Arcanine, Parasect and Venusaur can now learn Surf. With this change,  Flash, Cut, Strength, Fly or Dig, and Surf.
- Modifications to my personal taste:
  - Gyarados can now learn Fly.
  - Splash is now a signature move for Magikarps of level 20 or higher, as well as for Gyarados. The Move Mystic will tell you more. To make sure that Gyarados can be encountered in the wild with Splash, they now know Splash at level 1.
